## Davies lab Oceanographic Data Analysis Tools
#### A series of tools written in R that can be used for working with ocean data.

These various scripts underpin much of the research we've done into the distribution and niches of marine species. The scripts include working with physical oceanographic and geological data, as well as scripts to process data offloaded from our lander platforms. All tools are released under the MIT License.

The tools are loosely grouped into the following:

* Lander Tools
  * Series of scripts to process data obtained from sensors on our landers.

* Physical Data
  * Tools working with physical oceanographic and geological data.

* Deep-sea SDM Tools
  * Tools for predictive habitat suitability modelling.

* Visualisation Tools
  * For visualising and organising complex data.
