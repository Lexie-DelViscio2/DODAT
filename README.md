## Davies lab Oceanographic Data Analysis Tools
#### A series of tools written in R that can be used for working with ocean data.

These various scripts underpin much of the research we've done into distribution modeling for deep-sea species, working with physical oceanographic and geological data. All tools are released under the MIT License.

The tools are loosely grouped into the following:

* Physical Data
  * Tools working with physical oceanographic and geological data.

* Deep-sea SDM Tools
  * Tools for predictive habitat suitability modelling.

* Visualisation Tools
  * For visualising and organising complex data.
